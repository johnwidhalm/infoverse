## Task Management

### [Org Mode](orgmode.md)

* New: Refile from the capture window.

    If you refile from the capture window, [until this issue is solved](https://github.com/joaomsa/telescope-orgmode.nvim/issues/4), your task will be refiled but the capture window won't be closed.
    
    Be careful that it only refiles the first task there is, so you need to close the capture before refiling the next

# Coding

## Languages

### [Libraries](python_gnupg.md)

* New: Receive keys from a keyserver.

    ```python
    import_result = gpg.recv_keys('server-name', 'keyid1', 'keyid2', ...)
    ```

### [BeautifulSoup](docker.md)

* New: [Searching by attribute and value.](beautifulsoup.md#searching-by-attribute-and-value)

    ```python
    soup = BeautifulSoup(html)
    results = soup.findAll("td", {"valign" : "top"})
    ```

* New: [Install a specific version of Docker.](docker.md#installation)

    Follow [these instructions](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)
    
    If that doesn't install the version of `docker-compose` that you want use [the next snippet](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/49839028/how-to-upgrade-docker-compose-to-latest-version):
    
    ```bash
    VERSION=$(curl --silent https://api.github.com/repos/docker/compose/releases/latest | grep -Po '"tag_name": "\K.*\d')
    DESTINATION=/usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo curl -L https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/${VERSION}/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m) -o $DESTINATION
    sudo chmod 755 $DESTINATION
    ```
    
    If you don't want the latest version set the `VERSION` variable.

### [Python Snippets](python_snippets.md)

* New: [Read file with Pathlib.](python_snippets.md#read-file-with-pathlib)

    ```python
    file_ = Path('/to/some/file')
    file_.read_text()
    ```

* New: [Get changed time of a file.](python_snippets.md#get-changed-time-of-a-file)

    ```python
    import os
    
    os.path.getmtime(path)
    ```

### [Pydantic](pydantic.md)

* Correction: [Initialize attributes at object creation.](pydantic.md#initialize-attributes-at-object-creation)

    `pydantic` recommends [using root validators](pydantic.md#using-root-validators), but it's difficult to undestand how to do it and to debug the errors. You also don't have easy access to the default values of the model. I'd rather use the [overwriting the `__init__` method](pydantic.md#overwriting-the-__init__-method).
    
    ```python
    class fish(BaseModel):
        name: str
        color: str
    
        def __init__(self, **kwargs):
            super().__init__(**kwargs)
            print("Fish initialization successful!")
            self.color=complex_function()
    ```

### [questionary](questionary.md)

* New: [Autocomplete answers.](questionary.md#autocomplete-answers)

    If you want autocomplete with fuzzy finding use:
    
    ```python
    import questionary
    from prompt_toolkit.completion import FuzzyWordCompleter
    
    questionary.autocomplete(
        "Save to (q to cancel): ",
        choices=destination_directories,
        completer=FuzzyWordCompleter(destination_directories),
    ).ask()
    ```

## Infrastructure as Code

### [Ansible Snippets](ansible_snippets.md)

* New: [Ansible add a sleep.](ansible_snippets.md#ansible-add-a-sleep)

    ```yaml
    - name: Pause for 5 minutes to build app cache
      ansible.builtin.pause:
        minutes: 5
    ```

## Storage

### [OpenZFS](zfs.md)

* New: [Repair a DEGRADED pool.](zfs.md#repair-a-degraded-pool)

    First let’s offline the device we are going to replace:
    
    ```bash
    zpool offline tank0 ata-WDC_WD2003FZEX-00SRLA0_WD-xxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```
    
    Now let us have a look at the pool status.
    
    ```bash
    zpool status
    
    NAME                                            STATE     READ WRITE CKSUM
    tank0                                           DEGRADED     0     0     0
      raidz2-1                                      DEGRADED     0     0     0
        ata-TOSHIBA_HDWN180_xxxxxxxxxxxx            ONLINE       0     0     0
        ata-TOSHIBA_HDWN180_xxxxxxxxxxxx            ONLINE       0     0     0
        ata-TOSHIBA_HDWN180_xxxxxxxxxxxx            ONLINE       0     0     0
        ata-WDC_WD80EFZX-68UW8N0_xxxxxxxx           ONLINE       0     0     0
        ata-TOSHIBA_HDWG180_xxxxxxxxxxxx            ONLINE       0     0     0
        ata-TOSHIBA_HDWG180_xxxxxxxxxxxx            ONLINE       0     0     0
        ata-WDC_WD2003FZEX-00SRLA0_WD-xxxxxxxxxxxx  OFFLINE      0     0     0
        ata-ST4000VX007-2DT166_xxxxxxxx             ONLINE       0     0     0
    ```
    
    Sweet, the device is offline (last time it didn't show as offline for me, but the offline command returned a status code of 0).
    
    Time to shut the server down and physically replace the disk.
    
    ```bash
    shutdown -h now
    ```
    
    When you start again the server, it’s time to instruct ZFS to replace the removed device with the disk we just installed.
    
    ```bash
    zpool replace tank0 \
        ata-WDC_WD2003FZEX-00SRLA0_WD-xxxxxxxxxxxx \
        /dev/disk/by-id/ata-TOSHIBA_HDWG180_xxxxxxxxxxxx
    ```
    
    ```bash
    zpool status tank0
    
    pool: main
    state: DEGRADED
    status: One or more devices is currently being resilvered.  The pool will
            continue to function, possibly in a degraded state.
    action: Wait for the resilver to complete.
      scan: resilver in progress since Fri Sep 22 12:40:28 2023

    ```
    
    The disk is replaced and getting resilvered (which may take a long time to run (18 hours in a 8TB disk in my case).
    
    Once the resilvering is done; this is what the pool looks like.
    
    ```bash
    zpool list
    
    NAME      SIZE  ALLOC   FREE  EXPANDSZ   FRAG    CAP  DEDUP  HEALTH  ALTROOT
    tank0    43.5T  33.0T  10.5T     14.5T     7%    75%  1.00x  ONLINE  -
    ```

* New: Stop a ZFS scrub.

    ```bash
    zpool scrub -s my_pool
    ```

## Monitoring

### [Grafana](grafana.md)

* Correction: Improve installation method.

    Add more configuration values such as:
    
    ```
    GF_SERVER_ENABLE_GZIP="true"
    
    GF_AUTH_GENERIC_OAUTH_ALLOW_ASSIGN_GRAFANA_ADMIN="true"
    
    GF_LOG_MODE="console file"
    GF_LOG_LEVEL="info"
    ```

* Correction: [Warning when configuring datasources.](grafana.md#configure-datasources)

    Be careful to set the `timeInterval` variable to the value of how often you scrape the data from the node exporter to avoid [this issue](https://github.com/rfmoz/grafana-dashboards/issues/137).

# Operating Systems

## Linux

### [Linux Snippets](linux_snippets.md)

* New: [Limit the resources a docker is using.](linux_snippets.md#limit-the-resources-a-docker-is-using)

    You can either use limits in the `docker` service itself, see [1](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/537645/how-to-limit-docker-total-resources) and [2](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/systemd.resource-control.html).
    
    Or/and you can limit it for each docker, see [1](https://www.baeldung.com/ops/docker-memory-limit) and [2](https://docs.docker.com/config/containers/resource_constraints/).

### [Vial](vial.md)

* New: Introduce Vial.

    [Vial](https://get.vial.today/) is an open-source cross-platform (Windows, Linux and Mac) GUI and a QMK fork for configuring your keyboard in real time.
    
    Even though you can use a [web version](https://vial.rocks/) you can install it locally through an [AppImage](https://itsfoss.com/use-appimage-linux/)
    
    - Download [the latest version](https://get.vial.today/download/)
    - Give it execution permissions
    - Add the file somewhere in your `$PATH`
    
    On linux you [need to configure an `udev` rule](https://get.vial.today/manual/linux-udev.html).
    
    For a universal access rule for any device with Vial firmware, run this in your shell while logged in as your user (this will only work with sudo installed):
    
    ```bash
    export USER_GID=`id -g`; sudo --preserve-env=USER_GID sh -c 'echo "KERNEL==\"hidraw*\", SUBSYSTEM==\"hidraw\", ATTRS{serial}==\"*vial:f64c2b3c*\", MODE=\"0660\", GROUP=\"$USER_GID\", TAG+=\"uaccess\", TAG+=\"udev-acl\"" > /etc/udev/rules.d/99-vial.rules && udevadm control --reload && udevadm trigger'
    ```
    
    This command will automatically create a `udev` rule and reload the `udev` system.
    

## [Gardening](gardening.md)

* New: [Fertilizing with manure.](gardening.md#fertilizing-with-manure)

    Manure is one of the best organic fertilizers for plants. It's made by the accumulation of excrements of bats, sea birds and seals and it usually doesn't contain additives or synthetic chemical components.
    
    This fertilizer is rich in nitrogen, phosphorus and potassium, which are key minerals for the growth of plants. These components help the regeneration of the soil, the enrichment in terms of nutrients and also acts as fungicide preventing plagues.
    
    Manure is a fertilizer of slow absorption, which means that it's released to the plants in an efficient, controlled and slow pace. That way the plants take the nutrients when they need them.
    
    The best moment to use it is at spring and depending on the type of plant you should apply it between each month and a half and three months. It's use in winter is not recommended, as it may burn the plant's roots.
    
    Manure can be obtained in dust or liquid state. The first is perfect to scatter directly over the earth, while the second is better used on plant pots. You don't need to use much, in fact, with just a pair of spoons per pot is enough. Apply it around the base of the plant, avoiding it's touch with leaves, stem or exposed roots, as it may burn them. After you apply them remember to water them often, keep in mind that it's like a heavy greasy sandwich for the plants, and they need water to digest it.
    
    For my indoor plants I'm going to apply a small dose (one spoon per plant) at the start of Autumn (first days of September), and two spoons at the start of spring (first days of March).
