### [Org Mode](orgmode.md)

* New: [The orgmode repository file organization.](orgmode.md#the-orgmode-repository-file-organization)

    How to structure the different orgmode files is something that has always confused me, each one does it's own way, and there are no good posts on why one structure is better than other, people just state what they do.
    
    I've started with a typical [gtd](gtd.md) structure with a directory for the `todo` another for the `calendar` then another for the `references`. In the `todo` I had a file for personal stuff, another for each of my work clients, and the `someday.org`. Soon making the internal links was cumbersome so I decided to merge the personal `todo.org` and the `someday.org` into the same file and use folds to hide uninteresting parts of the file. The reality is that I feel that orgmode is less responsive and that I often feel lost in the file.
    
    I'm now more into the idea of having files per project in a flat structure and use an index.org file to give it some sense in the same way I do with the mkdocs repositories. Then I'd use internal links in the todo.org file to organize the priorities of what to do next.
    
    Benefits:
    
    - As we're using a flat structure at file level, the links between the files are less cumbersome `file:./project.org::*heading`. We only need to have unique easy to remember names for the files, instead of having to think on which directory was the file I want to make the link to. The all in one file structure makes links even easier, just `*heading`, but the disadvantages make it not worth it.
    - You have the liberty to have a generic link like `Work on project` or if you want to fine grain it, link the specific task of the project
    - The todo file will get smaller.
    - It has been the natural evolution of other knowledge repositories such as blue
    
    Cons:
    
    - Filenames must be unique. It hasn't been a problem in blue.
    - Blue won't be flattened into Vida as it's it's own knowledge repository

* New: [Syncronize orgmode repositories.](orgmode.md#synchronizations)

    I use orgmode both at the laptop and the mobile, I want to syncronize some files between both with the next requisites:
    
    - The files should be available on the devices when I'm not at home
    - The synchronization will be done only on the local network
    - The synchronization mechanism will only be able to see the files that need to be synched.
    - Different files can be synced to different devices. If I have three devices (laptop, mobile, tablet) I want to sync all mobile files to the laptop but just some to the tablet).
    
    Right now I'm already using [syncthing](syncthing.md) to sync files between the mobile and my server, so it's tempting to use it also to solve this issue. So the first approach is to spawn a syncthing docker at the laptop that connects with the server to sync the files whenever I'm at home.
    
    I've investigated the next options:
    
    - [Mount the whole orgmode repository with syncthing](orgmode.md#mount-the-whole-orgmode-repository-with-syncthing)
    - [Mount a specific directory to sync](orgmode.md#mount-a-specific-directory-to-sync)
    - [Use the org-orgzly script](orgmode.md#use-the-org-orgzly-script)

# Coding

## Languages

### [mkdocstrings](mkdocstrings.md)

* Correction: Correct the watch directive.

    `watch` is a list of directories to watch while serving the documentation. So if any file is changed in those directories, the documentation is rebuilt.

# DevOps

## Infrastructure as Code

### [Ansible Snippets](ansible_snippets.md)

* New: [Ansible lint skip some rules.](ansible_snippets.md#ansible-lint-skip-some-rules)

    Add a `.ansible-lint-ignore` file with a line per rule to ignore with the syntax `path/to/file rule_to_ignore`.

## Infrastructure Solutions

### [Velero](velero.md)

* New: [Create a backup.](velero.md#create-a-backup)

    If you already have schedules select the one you want to use:
    
    ```bash
    velero schedules get
    ```
    
    Then create the backup with:
    
    ```bash
    velero backup create --from-schedule selected-schedule
    ```
    
    You can see the other options to create backups in `velero backup create --help`

### [OpenZFS storage planning](zfs_storage_planning.md)
