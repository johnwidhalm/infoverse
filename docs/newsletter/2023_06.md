### [asyncio](asyncio.md)

* New: [Basic concepts of concurrency.](asyncio.md#concurrency)

    Concurrency is best explained by an example stolen from [Miguel Grinberg](https://youtu.be/iG6fr81xHKA?t=4m29s).
    
    Chess master Judit Polgár hosts a chess exhibition in which she plays multiple amateur players. She has two ways of conducting the exhibition: synchronously and asynchronously.
    
    Assumptions:
    
    - 24 opponents
    - Judit makes each chess move in 5 seconds
    - Opponents each take 55 seconds to make a move
    - Games average 30 pair-moves (60 moves total)
    
    Synchronous version: Judit plays one game at a time, never two at the same time, until the game is complete. Each game takes (55 + 5) * 30 == 1800 seconds, or 30 minutes. The entire exhibition takes 24 * 30 == 720 minutes, or 12 hours.
    
    Asynchronous version: Judit moves from table to table, making one move at each table. She leaves the table and lets the opponent make their next move during the wait time. One move on all 24 games takes Judit 24 * 5 == 120 seconds, or 2 minutes. The entire exhibition is now cut down to 120 * 30 == 3600 seconds, or just 1 hour.
    
    Async IO takes long waiting periods in which functions would otherwise be blocking and allows other functions to run during that downtime. (A function that blocks effectively forbids others from running from the time that it starts until the time that it returns.)

### [aiohttp](aiohttp.md)

* New: Introduce aiohttp.

    [`aiohttp`](https://docs.aiohttp.org/en/stable/) is an asynchronous HTTP Client/Server for asyncio and Python. Think of it as the `requests` for asyncio.

### [Configure Docker to host the application](docker.md)

* New: [Remove the apt cache after installing a package.](docker.md#remove-the-apt-cache-after-installing-a-package)

    ```
    RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y \
      python3 \
      python3-pip \
      && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/*
    ```

* New: [Add the contents of a directory to the docker.](docker.md#add-the-contents-of-a-directory-to-the-docker)

    ```
    ADD ./path/to/directory /path/to/destination
    ```

## Infrastructure as Code

### [Ansible Snippets](ansible_snippets.md)

* New: [Authorize an SSH key.](ansible_snippets.md#authorize-an-ssh-key)

    ```yaml
    - name: Authorize the sender ssh key
      authorized_key:
        user: syncoid
        state: present
        key: "{{ syncoid_receive_ssh_key }}"
    ```

* New: [Create a user.](ansible_snippets.md#create-a-user)

    The following snippet creates a user with password login disabled.
    
    ```yaml
    - name: Create the syncoid user
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: syncoid
        state: present
        password: !
        shell: /usr/sbin/nologin
    ```
    
    If you don't set a password any user can do `su your_user` to set a random password use the next snippet:
    
    ```yaml
    - name: Create the syncoid user
      ansible.builtin.user:
        name: syncoid
        state: present
        password: "{{ lookup('password', '/dev/null', length=50, encrypt='sha512_crypt') }}"
        shell: /bin/bash
    ```
    
    This won't pass the idempotence tests as it doesn't save the password anywhere (`/dev/null`) in the controler machine.

* New: [Create an ssh key.](ansible_snippets.md#create-an-ssh-key)

    ```yaml
    - name: Create .ssh directory
      become: true
      file:
        path: /root/.ssh
        state: directory
        mode: 700
    
    - name: Create the SSH key to directory
      become: true
      openssh_keypair:
        path: /root/.ssh/id_ed25519
        type: ed25519
      register: ssh
    
    - name: Show public key
      debug:
        var: ssh.public_key
    ```

* New: [Skip ansible-lint for some tasks.](ansible_snippets.md#skip-ansible-lint-for-some-tasks)

    ```yaml
    - name: Modify permissions
      command: >
        chmod -R g-w /home/user
      tags:
        - skip_ansible_lint
      sudo: yes
    ```

### [Chezmoi](molecule.md)

* Correction: Give some tip to deal with big diffs.

    Sometimes the `diff` is too big and you need to work with it chuck by chunk. For each change you can either:
    
    - `chezmoi add <target>` if you want to keep the changes you've manually made to the files that match the `<target>`.
    - `chezmoi apply <target>` if you want to apply the changes that chezmoi proposes for the `<target>`.
    
    Here `<target>` is any directory or file listed in the `diff`.

* New: Add systemd service for the actions runner.

    ```
    [Unit]
    Description=Gitea Actions Runner
    After=network.target
    
    [Service]
    WorkingDirectory=/var/gitea/gitea/act_runner/main
    ExecStart=/var/gitea/gitea/act_runner/main/act_runner-main-linux-amd64 daemon
    
    [Install]
    WantedBy=default.target
    ```

* New: [Tweak the runner image.](gitea.md#tweak-the-runner-image)

    The [gitea runner](https://docs.gitea.com/next/usage/actions/act-runner/#labels) uses the `node:16-bullseye` image by default, in that image [the `setup-python` action doesn't work](https://itsthejoker.github.io/gitea_actions_and_python/). You can tweak the docker image that the runner runs by editing the `.runner` file that is in the directory where you registered the runner (probably close to the `act_runner` executable).
    
    If you open that up, you’ll see that there is a section called labels, and it (most likely) looks like this:
    
    ```json
    "labels": [
      "ubuntu-latest:docker://node:16-bullseye",
      "ubuntu-22.04:docker://node:16-bullseye",
      "ubuntu-20.04:docker://node:16-bullseye",
      "ubuntu-18.04:docker://node:16-buster"
    ]
    ```
    
    You can specify any other docker image. Adding new labels doesn't work yet.

* New: Introduce molecule.

    [Molecule](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule) is a testing tool for ansible roles.
    
    - [Source](https://github.com/ansible-community/molecule)
    - [Docs](https://molecule.rtfd.io/)

* New: [CI configuration.](molecule.md#ci-configuration)

    Since gitea supports github actions you can use the `setup-molecule` and `setup-lint` actions. For example:
    
    ```yaml
    ---
    name: Molecule
    
    "on":
      pull_request:
    
    env:
      PY_COLORS: "1"
      ANSIBLE_FORCE_COLOR: "1"
    jobs:
      lint:
        name: Lint
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - name: Checkout the codebase
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
          - name: Setup Lint
            uses: bec-galaxy/setup-lint@{Version}
    
          - name: Run Lint tests
            run: ansible-lint
    
      molecule:
        name: Molecule
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        needs: lint
        steps:
          - name: Checkout the codebase
            uses: actions/checkout@v3
    
          - name: Setup Molecule
            uses: bec-galaxy/setup-molecule@{Version}
    
          - name: Run Molecule tests
            run: molecule test
    ```
    
    [That action](https://github.com/bec-galaxy/setup-molecule/blob/main/action.yml) installs the latest version of the packages, if you need to check a specific version of the packages you may want to create your own step or your own action.

* New: [Upgrade to v5.0.0.](molecule.md#to-v5.0.0)

    They've removed the `lint` command, the reason behind is that there are two different testing methods which are expected to be run in very different ways. Linting should be run per entire repository. Molecule executions are per scenario and one project can have even >100 scenarios. Running lint on each of them would not only slowdown but also increase the maintenance burden on linter configuration and the way is called.
    
    They recommend users to run `ansible-lint` using `pre-commit` with or without `tox. That gives much better control over how/when it is updated.
    
    You can see an example on how to do this in the [CI configuration section](#ci-configuration).

## Infrastructure Solutions

### [AWS Snippets](aws_snippets.md)

* New: [Get EC2 metadata from within the instance.](aws_snippets.md#get-ec2-metadata-from-within-the-instance)

    The quickest way to fetch or retrieve EC2 instance metadata from within a running EC2 instance is to log in and run the command:
    
    Fetch metadata from IPv4:
    
    ```bash
    curl -s http://169.254.169.254/latest/dynamic/instance-identity/document
    ```
    
    You can also download the `ec2-metadata` tool to get the info:
    
    ```bash
    wget http://s3.amazonaws.com/ec2metadata/ec2-metadata
    
    chmod +x ec2-metadata
    
    ./ec2-metadata --all
    ```

## Storage

### [Sanoid](sanoid.md)

* Correction: Use the recursive flag.

    `recursive` is not set by default, so the dataset's children won't be backed up unless you set this option.
    
    ```
     [main/backup]
       use_template = daily
       recursive = yes
    ```
    

## Monitoring

### [AlertManager](alertmanager.md)

* New: [Alertmanager routes.](alertmanager.md#route)

    A route block defines a node in a routing tree and its children. Its optional
    configuration parameters are inherited from its parent node if not set.
    
    Every alert enters the routing tree at the configured top-level route, which
    must match all alerts (i.e. not have any configured matchers). It then traverses
    the child nodes. If continue is set to false, it stops after the first matching
    child. If continue is true on a matching node, the alert will continue matching
    against subsequent siblings. If an alert does not match any children of a node
    (no matching child nodes, or none exist), the alert is handled based on the
    configuration parameters of the current node.
    
    A basic configuration would be:
    
    ```yaml
    route:
      group_by: [job, alertname, severity]
      group_wait: 30s
      group_interval: 5m
      repeat_interval: 12h
      receiver: 'email'
      routes:
        - match:
            alertname: Watchdog
          receiver: 'null'
    ```

* New: UPGRADE FAILED: another operation (install/upgrade/rollback) is in progress.

    This error can happen for few reasons, but it most commonly occurs when there is an interruption during the upgrade/install process as you already mentioned.
    
    To fix this one may need to, first rollback to another version, then reinstall or helm upgrade again.
    
    Try below command to list the available charts:
    
    ```bash
    helm ls --namespace <namespace>
    ```
    
    You may note that when running that command ,it may not show any columns with information. If that's the case try to check the history of the previous deployment
    
    ```bash
    helm history <release> --namespace <namespace>
    ```
    
    This provides with information mostly like the original installation was never completed successfully and is pending state something like STATUS: `pending-upgrade` state.
    
    To escape from this state, use the rollback command:
    
    ```bash
    helm rollback <release> <revision> --namespace <namespace>
    ```
    
    `revision` is optional, but you should try to provide it.
    
    You may then try to issue your original command again to upgrade or reinstall.
