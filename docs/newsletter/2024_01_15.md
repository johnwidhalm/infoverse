### [OpenZFS](zfs.md)

* New: Solve the pool or dataset is busy error.

    If you get an error of `pool or dataset is busy` run the next command to see which process is still running on the pool:
    
    ```bash
    lsof 2>/dev/null | grep dataset-name
    ```

### [ZFS Prometheus exporter](zfs_exporter.md)

* Correction: Tweak the zfs_exporter target not available error.

    Remember to set the `scrape_timeout` to at least of `60s` as the exporter is sometimes slow to answer, specially on low hardware resources.
    
    ```yaml
     - job_name: zfs_exporter
       metrics_path: /metrics
       scrape_timeout: 60s
       static_configs:
       - targets: [192.168.3.236:9134]
       metric_relabel_configs:
       ...
    ```

### [Kodi](kodi.md)

* New: Start working on a migration script to mediatracker.

### [Mediatracker](mediatracker.md)

* New: [How to use the mediatracker API.](mediatracker.md#api)

    I haven't found a way to see the api docs from my own instance. Luckily you can browse it [at the official instance](https://bonukai.github.io/MediaTracker/).
    
    You can create an application token on your user configuration. Then you can use it with something similar to:
    
    ```bash
    curl -H 'Content-Type: application/json' https://mediatracker.your-domain.org/api/logs\?token\=your-token | jq
    ```

### [Rocketchat](rocketchat.md)

* New: [How to use Rocketchat's API.](rocketchat.md#api)

    The API docs are a bit weird, you need to go to [endpoints](https://developer.rocket.chat/reference/api/rest-api/endpoints) and find the one you need. Your best bet though is to open the browser network console and see which requests they are doing and then to find them in the docs.
