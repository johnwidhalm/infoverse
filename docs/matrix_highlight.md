[Matrix Highlight](https://github.com/DanilaFe/matrix-highlight) is a decentralized and federated way of annotating the web based on Matrix. 

Think of it as an open source alternative to [hypothesis](hypothesis.md).

It's similar to [Populus](https://github.com/opentower/populus-viewer) but for the web.

I want to try it and investigate further specially if you can:

- Easily extract the annotations
- Activate it by default everywhere
