# Process underlined e-books

I use Kobo to read and underline technical and political books. So far I've had a bad time extracting the knowledge into [anki](anki.md) or this blue book.

Maybe [kobo2calibre](https://github.com/degiz/kobo2calibre) could help to Embed highlights from Kobo device in Calibre book.
