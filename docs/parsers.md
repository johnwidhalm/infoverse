# Learning about parsers

Parsers are a whole world. I kind of feel a bit lost right now and I'm searching for good books on the topic. So far I've found:

- [Crafting Interpreters](https://craftinginterpreters.com/introduction.html).
  
  Pros:
  - Pleasant to read
  - Doesn't use external tools, you implement it from scratch.
  - Multiple format: EPUB, PDF, web
  - You can read it for free
  - Cute drawings <3

  Cons:
  - Code snippets are on Java and C
  - Doesn't use external tools, you implement it from scratch
  - It's long

- Compilers: Principles, Techniques, and Tools by Aho, Alfred V. & Monica S. Lam & Ravi Sethi & Jeffrey D. Ullman

  Pros: 
  - EPUB

  Cons:
  - Code snippets are on C++

- Parsing Techniques: A Practical Guide by Dick Grune and Ceriel J.H Jacobs

  Pros:
  - Gives an overview of many grammars and parsers

  Cons:
  - Only in PDF
  - It's long
  - Too focused on the theory, despite the name xD
