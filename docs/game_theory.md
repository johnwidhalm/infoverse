# [Evolution of trust](https://ncase.me/trust/)

Game theory shows us the three things we need for the evolution of trust:

- Repeat interactions: Trust keeps a relationship going, but you need the knowledge of possible future repeat interactions before trust can evolve
- Possible win-wins: You must be playing a non-zero-sum game, a game where it's at least possible that both players can be better off -- a win-win.
- Low miscommunication: If the level of miscommunication is too high, trust breaks down. But when there's a little bit of miscommunication, it pays to be more forgiving
