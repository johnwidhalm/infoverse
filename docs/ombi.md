[Ombi](https://ombi.io/) is a self-hosted web application that automatically
gives your shared Jellyfin users the ability to request content by themselves!
Ombi can be linked to multiple TV Show and Movie DVR tools to create a seamless
end-to-end experience for your users.

If Ombi is not for you, you may try [Overseerr](https://overseerr.dev/).

# Tips

## [Set default quality of request per user](https://docs.ombi.app/guides/usermanagement/#quality-root-path-preferences)

Sometimes one specific user continuously asks for a better quality of the content. If you go into the user configuration (as admin) you can set the default quality profiles for that user.
